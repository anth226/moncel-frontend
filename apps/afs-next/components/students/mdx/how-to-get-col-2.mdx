**Where Should I Put the Display Certificate?**

The Food Safety Display Certificate should be placed in a prominent position where it can be seen by as many customers as possible.

Suggested locations include:

- near the entrance of your business
- next to the cash register
- close to an open kitchen
- on a wall with other certificates and important business information
