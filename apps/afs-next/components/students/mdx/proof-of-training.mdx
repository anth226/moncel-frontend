The Food Safety Display Certificate is <u>not your proof of training</u>. Think of it as signage to demonstrate to customers that you take food safety seriously.

If you are subject to a food safety inspection, you need to show the Health Inspector:

- your Statement of Attainment, or
- your Food Safety Card (as shown)

Both of these items will be sent to you as soon as you complete your Food Safety Supervisor course.
