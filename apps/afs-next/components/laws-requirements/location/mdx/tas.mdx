**Regulating & monitoring food safety in Tasmania**

Food safety in Tasmania is governed by the Food Act 2003 (TAS).

This Act requires that all food sold in Tasmania is safe and suitable for human consumption and meets all standards set out in the Food Standards Code. The Department of Health & Human Services in Tasmania enforces these regulations.

**Food business registration**

It's an offence in Tasmania to conduct a food business at any premises unless the food business is registered with the appropriate enforcement agency.

**Mobile food businesses**

In Tasmania, a distinction is made between mobile food businesses and other types of food businesses. A mobile food business can choose to apply for a once-off temporary registration or for statewide registration.

Mobile food businesses include mobile pizza ovens, custom-built barbeques and food sold from temporary structures such as tables, stalls and booths.
