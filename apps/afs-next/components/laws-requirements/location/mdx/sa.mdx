**Regulating & monitoring food safety in South Australia**

Food safety in South Australia is governed by the Food Safety Act 2001.

This Act requires that all food sold in South Australia is safe and suitable for human consumption and meets all standards set out in the Food Standards Code.

SA Health enforces these regulations and will assist food business with their food safety planning. However, it is up to the business to ensure they comply with food safety laws and regulations.

**Food Safety Rating Scheme**

South Australian food businesses are rated using SA Health's Food Safety Rating Scheme.

This scheme, also referred to as "scores-on-doors", allows state and local councils to rate a food business based on the results of routine food safety inspections.

The result is represented as either a number, letter or star rating and is displayed at the food business.

**Food business classification**

Food businesses in SA are classified according to the level of risk that they present.

* Priority 1 (P1) businesses are the highest risk.
* Priority 4 (P4) businesses are the lowest risk.

These classifications are used to determine priority for inspection, inspection frequency and which regulatory requirements need to be applied.
