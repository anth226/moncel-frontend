**Regulating & monitoring food safety in Western Australia**

Food safety in Western Australia is governed by the Food Act 2008 (WA).

This Act requires that all food sold in Western Australia is safe and suitable for human consumption and meets all standards set out in the Food Standards Code. WA Health enforces these regulations.

**Food business registration**

It's an offence in WA to conduct a food business at any premises unless it's registered with the appropriate enforcement agency.

Food business registration is not only required for fixed premises, it's also necessary to register your food business if you are operating a market stall, food truck or any other type of mobile food business.

**Food Offenders List**

WA Health has a publicly available Food Offenders List. This list contains details of all food businesses and persons that have been convicted of an offence under the Food Act 2008.

Details remain on the Food Offenders List for up to 24 months.
