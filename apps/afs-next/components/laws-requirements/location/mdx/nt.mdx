**Regulating & monitoring food safety in the Northern Territory**

Food safety in the Northern Territory is governed by the Food Act 2004 (NT).

This Act requires that all food sold in the Northern Territory is safe and suitable for human consumption and meets all standards set out in the Food Standards Code.

The NT Department of Health enforces these regulations and assists food businesses by providing food recall information and food safety resources on their website.

**Food business registration**

As of 1 January 2015, all food businesses need to be registered.

This registration allows the Department to identify the risks of the business, provide them with information about food safety including recalls, identify sources of food-borne illness, target inspections and respond to complaints more effectively.

Businesses must pay an annual registration fee to the Department of Health based on their food business classification.

**Food business classification**

Food businesses in the NT are classified according to the level of risk that they present. There are four levels of classification based on the following:

* Food type and intended customer use
* Activity of the business
* Method of processing
* Customer base
