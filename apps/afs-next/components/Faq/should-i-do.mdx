This depends on what you want to get out of your training.

If you want to learn how to prepare, handle and serve food safely, but not how to supervise a business in food safety, then you would choose a Food Handler course.

However if you wish to be employed as a business’s Food Safety Supervisor, you will need to complete a nationally recognised course which teaches you not just the safest ways to handle and prepare food, but also how to properly monitor and maintain safe food practices in a food business.

Even though a Food Safety Supervisor course is more extensive than a Food Handler course, because having a Food Safety Supervisor is usually required in order for a food business to be granted a food business licence, it’s often worth still completing the full Food Safety Supervisor course.
