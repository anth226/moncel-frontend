A Food Safety Supervisor course teaches the skills required to supervise and provide guidance about safe food handling in a food business. This includes helping to improve food safety and hygiene standards as well as reducing potential health risks. Most food businesses in Australia are required to nominate at least one Food Safety Supervisor.

If you wish to be employed as a businessâ€™s Food Safety Supervisor, you will need to complete a nationally recognised Food Safety Supervisor training course from a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) which teaches you not just the safest ways to handle and prepare food but also how to properly monitor and maintain safe food practices in a food business.

The Australian Institute of Food Safety is a Registered Training Organisation that provides nationally recognised Food Safety Supervisor training that can be completed online. This course provides all the requirements for anyone who will be monitoring the overall state of food safety in a food business.
