Yes, you can. An online Food Safety Supervisor course provides students with flexible learning options that let them complete the units at their own pace. This means it can be tailor-made to a person’s individual needs.

Because students don’t have to attend physical classes, they can study wherever and whenever it suits them. Considering how busy everyday life continues to become, this is often the deciding factor for students who are looking to complete a Food Safety Supervisor course.

You can do the Australian Institute of Food Safety’s online Food Safety Supervisor course in under a day. Or, because the system automatically saves your progress, you can log in and out as many times as you like for a year following enrolment.
