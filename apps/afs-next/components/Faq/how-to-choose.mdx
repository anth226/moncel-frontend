At the Australian Institute of Food Safety, we offer a variety of food safety courses for you to choose from. But, how do you decide which one is right for you? Finding out which course you need to do will depend on your situation.

Our students complete courses with us for lots of different reasons. They might be applying for a job that requires a Food Handler Certificate, or setting up a food van and need a Food Safety Supervisor Certificate, or just want to learn some of the basics. Whatever the reason, our nationally recognised courses meet all legislative requirements across Australia and will give you the food safety knowledge you need.

### Online food safety courses

At an introductory level, we have a non-accredited course called Introduction to Food Safety, which teaches students basic food safety skills. After this course is completed, students receive a certificate of completion.

We also have a nationally recognised Food Handler Course. This course provides students with the knowledge and skills required to work as a Food Handler. Once they’ve finished, the students receive a nationally recognised Statement of Attainment for the unit of competency in their sector. This is more commonly known as a ‘Food Handling Certificate’.

We also offer the official AIFS Food Safety Supervisor Course. This is our most popular course, and not only teaches students all of the necessary skills for safe food handling but also how to monitor and maintain food safety in a business, including a Food Safety Program.

If you have already completed the Food Handler Course, then you can become a Food Safety Supervisor by taking our Advanced Food Safety Course (not applicable to students in New South Wales).

The most advanced level of food safety training AIFS provides is the Food Safety Manager Course. This course is non-accredited and provides more details on how to maximise food safety in a business as well as provides instructions on advanced food handling, organising and preparation skills.
