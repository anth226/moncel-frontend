Even though there are many similarities between the two, Food Safety Supervisor and Food Handler are two different positions. There are different training courses for each and different levels of responsibility in the workplace.

A Food Handler is just that, someone who handles food as part of their position. Whereas a Food Safety Supervisor is someone that handles food, supervises food handling staff, maintains the Food Safety Program, and makes sure a food business uses best food safety practices.

When it comes to training, a Food Handler course is not as involved or extensive as a Food Safety Supervisor course. Food Safety Supervisors not only learn all of the information in a Food Handler course, they also learn the skills and knowledge that go along with being able to supervise food safety in a business. While Food Handlers have to know how to update the Food Safety Plan of a business, it’s the Food Safety Supervisor who is responsible for its overall maintenance.
