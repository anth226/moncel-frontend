Depending on the course chosen, most students take between 3 and 8 hours to complete their online study. This includes the lessons, case studies and assessments. 

However, these time estimates don’t include on-site activities and practical work that you’ll need to complete as part of the observer report. The time it takes to do this section varies, and depends on your current situation.

Also, don’t forget that you don’t have to do the course all in one go. You can do as little or as much as you’d like in any one session. The course will remember where you were up to, so when you log back in, you can just pick up where you left off!

As for how long you have to complete your course, it’s valid for one year from the date you enrolled.
