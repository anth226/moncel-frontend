A Food Safety Supervisor course is quite different to a food handling course.

A food handling course, such as AIFS [Food Handlersâ€™ Course](/courses/food-handler-course), is designed to give a basic to intermediate level of competency in food safety. This qualification prepares you to work in a commercial kitchen.

A [Food Safety Supervisor course](/courses/food-safety-supervisor) is a higher tier of food safety training. It is designed to meet the legal requirements for a Food Safety Supervisor set by the Australian Government.

This nationally accredited course qualifies you to:

- Oversee a (Food Safety Program)[/blog/food-safety-programs-an-overview]
- Build a Food Safety Planning alignment with Australian law, with customised solutions for your business
- Direct and train staff in food safety
- Prepare the business for a food safety emergency
= Supervise all aspects of food safety in a business at a managerial level.

Most Australian food businesses must employ at least one person qualified as a Food Safety Supervisor to meet legal requirements in Australia. Please read the [Food Safety Programs: An Overview](/blog/food-safety-programs-an-overview) to check whether your food business falls into this category.
