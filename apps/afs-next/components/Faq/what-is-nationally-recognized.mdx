Training in Australia is highly regulated to ensure quality and consistency of training courses. Nationally recognised training means that the course is recognised by relevant industry groups and governing bodies nationwide.

Most of our courses at the Australian Institute of Food Safety are nationally recognised. You can tell which ones are nationally recognised because they display the triangular ‘nationally recognised training’ logo on the course page.

This means that the course is delivered in accordance with a nationally recognised training package, and your statement of attainment will be recognised throughout Australia. You can even choose to use the units of competency attained through this training towards a further qualification, such as a qualification in Hospitality.

### NSW Food Safety Supervisors

Although the statements of attainment that we issue are nationally recognised, if you live in NSW and want to work as a Food Safety Supervisor, you’ll also need to hold a special NSW Certificate. This is a NSW Food Authority requirement and is issued to students who complete our NSW Food Safety Supervisor course.
