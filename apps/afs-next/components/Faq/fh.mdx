A Food Handler course teaches the fundamental skills needed to perform the role of a food handler in the Australian food industry.

It teaches students how to recognise, control and prevent potential food safety hazards from occurring, so as to minimise the risk of individuals becoming sick. The course also includes lessons on the best and safest ways of handling food; maintaining good personal hygiene; and the responsibilities of all food handlers.

This course is suitable for workers who handle food as a part of their position but will not be monitoring the overall state of food safety for an entire business.

The official Australian Institute of Food Safety Food Handler course can be completed online in a matter of hours and is a great qualification for any food handler working in Australiaâ€™s busy food handling environment.
