The final exam takes up to one hour to complete."},{"__typename":"ComponentCoreFaq","Question":"What skills do I need to complete the course?","Answer":"We’ve tried to keep the course as simple as possible to accommodate for all types of learners. To complete the course, you'll only need basic skills in:\n\n1. **English language, literacy and numeracy**  \n   The course uses basic English that's easy for anyone to understand. There are some technical food safety terms that we do our best to explain as simply as possible. There are also some numerical skills required such as reading temperatures and performing simple calculations. As a general rule, if you can use an instant messenger tool, use email for work purposes, respond to customer complaints and follow a recipe, then you likely have the language, literacy and numeracy skills needed to complete the course. Please note, our course is currently only available in English.\n\n2. **Using a computer/accessing email**\n   The online course requires a basic level of computer literacy. You will be required to log on to the course and navigate through the lessons on the online course page. You’ll also receive some information via email so you’ll need to be familiar with the email system you use. If you’re able to confidently browse the internet, and send and reply to emails, then you’re likely to have the computer skills required to complete the course.\n\n3. **Independent study**  \n   This course is an online self-paced course which means that you can study when and where you want – but you must complete the course within 30 days of enrolment. Generally, this type of course requires some planning and organization from the student as there are no scheduled times or sessions. You’ll need to make sure that you allocate enough time within the 30 days to complete the course and consider the best way to learn using the online tools."},{"__typename":"ComponentCoreFaq","Question":"How long does the course take?","Answer":"The course typically takes students 8 hours to complete.
